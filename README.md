# bookstore

My work on the bookstore full-stack app

## Installation

First, run `npm install` to get it set up

NOTE: belows kills the database named bookstore

Then, get your postgresql server running and type in `psql -f ./db/schema.sql` to make and fill the database and tables

Then, run npm start to get the server started

After that you're ready to go

Also, you can run npm test if you want to run the tests
